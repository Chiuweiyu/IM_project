## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js 12+ (versions below could work, but are not tested)

## Install dependencies, this can take a minute

```
cd ~/YOUR_PATH_TO_FRONTED_DIRECTORY
npm install
```
# Start the local server

```
npm start
```

Your browser should now open and show the app. Otherwise open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Editing files will automatically refresh the page.

```
npm run build 
```

It will create a folder named build with your compiled project inside. After that copy its content into your webroot and you are ready to go.
